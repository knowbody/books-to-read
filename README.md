## About

In 2016 I'd like to challenge myself and make this year about reading. I never liked to read books,
although I enjoyed reading blog posts or some articles. The only books I would read in the past
where programming books. Last year I bought a Kindle and since then my view about reading has changed
a lot. I would read in the tube, before I went to bed, in the cafe, etc. In 2015 I managed to read around 30 books.
This year I would try to read a bit more.

Feel free to send PRs with the suggestions!
